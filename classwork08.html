		<p>Manatees, also known as sea cows, are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine 
		mammals. The three types of manatees are the West African manatee, the West Indian manatee,
		and the Amazonian manatee. Manatees are very peaceful animals that spend most of their 
		time munching on plants.</p>
		<p>Manatees usually weigh about 1,210 pounds and can grow to about 9.8 feet in length. 
		They have large paddle-like flippers and a large upper lip used for collecting food. They 
		spend 50% of the day sleeping underwater but must come up for air every 20 minutes.</p>
		<p>The main cause of death for manatees are human-related issues. These include habitat 
		destruction and human objects, like boats. Because manatees are slow moving creatures
		that usually occupy shallow waters, they are often struck by boat propellers causing
		deep cuts and sometimes even death. Fishing nets and lines also pose as a threat to 
		manatees. However, in recent years, the West Indian manatee has been moved down from the 
		endangered species list to the threatened species list due to habitat improvements and  
		the reduction of human-related threats.</p>
